   This documents how to post text and images to Slack within
   Bluesky plans.

   :Lesson: Obtain Slack development keys and uploader tokens.  Post
	    images and text to Slack using Bluesky.  This incorporates
	    readily into Bluesky measurement plans.  At BMM, these
	    tools are used to inform staff and users as XAS scans and
	    other time consuming chores are started and finished.
